Two problems will be assigned on Mondays (starting September 9) at 12 noon on bCourses, and students will have to submit their solutions by Wednesday at 5 pm electronically on Gradescope.
These problems will be graded by the GSIs.

```
!!!!No extensions will be allowed, and there will be no make-ups!!!!
```

Two (2) worst weekly scores of every student will be dropped.


The instructor will also post additional homework problems on bCourses every Tuesday and Thursday after the lecture; and solutions to these will be posted there Monday morning.
Solutions to these HW problems *will not be collected or graded*.
It’s in the students’ best interests to do HW on a regular basis, as these problems will be indicative of the kind of problems that will appear on the exams and on the weekly graded
problems sets.
It’s also a good idea to read ahead.
Reading assignments will be given one week in advance.
