#### Office hour

#### Exams

The midterm exam will be in class on **Thursday, October 10, 3:30-5 pm**.

The final exam will be on **Friday, December 20, 7-10 pm**.

#### Take-home quizzes

A quiz consisting of 2 problems will be assigned on Gradescope every Monday at 3 pm, from September 9 on (except for the midterm exam week, the week after the midterm exam, and the Thanksgiving week; Nov 11 quiz will be moved to Nov 13), and students will have to submit their solutions by Tuesday at 3 pm (one page per problem). During this 24-hour window, each student will have 60 minutes (from the time they open it) to work on the quiz and upload the solutions to Gradescope (this time period will be automatically enforced). Each student will have to do the quiz on their own, without anyone's help or any materials. **No sharing of problems during the 24-hour window. No extensions and no make-up quizzes.** Two (2) worst quiz scores of every student will be dropped.


#### Homeworks (do NOT submit)

The instructor will also post additional homework problems on bCourses (in Modules) every Tuesday and Thursday after the lecture. Solutions to these problems will be posted there the following Monday morning. They will not be collected or graded. However, it’s in the students' best interest to do these HW problems on a regular basis, as they will be indicative of the problems on the quizzes and the exams.

It’s also a good idea to read ahead. Reading assignments will be given one week in advance on bCourses (in Modules).


#### Grades

- Take-home quizzes: 20%
- Midterm: 30%
- Final: 50%
