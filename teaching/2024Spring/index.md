#### Discussion

* Section 102: Tue & Thu, 11:00 am - 12:30 pm, Dwinelle 130
* Section 104: Tue & Thu, 9:30 am - 11:00 am, Dwinelle 187

*We have Berkeley time - discussion will start 10 minutes later than stated above.*

#### Office hour

**Mon 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm, Wed 5:00 pm - 6:00 pm, Evans 1066**

You can go to any GSI's office hour if this conflicts with your schedules. Also, feel free to email me for any specific questions so that we can possibly have an extra meeting.

#### Homework

You need to submit homework **every Thursday**, at the end of the discussion. Also, you must submit only physical copy - **do not email me!**. Five problems wil be chosen at random to be graded for completion. Three of the lowest homework scores will be dropped. Working with others is encouraged, but you must write your solutions on your own and write the names of your collaborators at the top of the assignment.
Also, no homework for the first week.

#### Quizzes

**There are NO quizzes in this class!**

#### Attendance

Attendence will be checked at the end of every discussion. It is strongly encouraged to attend all the discussions. Also, attending all (two) discussions in a week would give **0.375%** extra credit, and a maximum of **3%** can be added in this way (so 8 weeks of full attendances will give you the maximum extra credit).

#### Q&A

Most of the questions are already answered in Norman Sheu's website above.
But in case you haven't find an answer to your question...

Q. I want to practice more. Are there any additional resources or excercises available?

A. You can find a bunch of resource in this website. See the previous classes I tought and you'll see what I mean.
