Five problems wil be chosen at random to be graded for completion. Two of the lowest homework scores will be dropped. Working with others is encouraged, but you must write your solutions on your own and write the names of your collaborators at the top of the assignment. 

#### Quizzes 
**There are NO quizzes in this class!**

#### Attendance

I may bring an attendence sheet for every discussion and you may need to check it at the end of every discussion.
It is strongly encouraged to attend all the discussions.
