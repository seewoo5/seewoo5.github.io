#### Attendence

I may bring an attendence sheet for every discussion and you may need to check it at the end of every discussion.
It is strongly encouraged to attend all the discussions.
Also, attending all three discussions in a week would give 0.5\% extra credit, and a maximum of 3\% can be added in this way.

#### Exams and Grading policies
* First exam: 15\%
* Second exam: 20\%
* Third exam: 20\%
* Final exam: 30\%
* Homework: 15\%
* additional credit by attendence for discussion: $\leq$ 3\%
