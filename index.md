I'm 3rd year graduate student in Mathematics at UC Berkeley. My advisor is [Sug Woo Shin](https://math.berkeley.edu/~swshin/).
I'm interested in number theory, especially about automorphic forms and representations in context of relative Langlands program.
I'm also interested in computer-assisted mathematics, like optimization problems or formalization of mathematics.
During the master's program at POSTECH, I was supervised by [YoungJu Choie](https://yjchoie.postech.ac.kr/).

This semester (Fall 2023), I'm organizing a learning seminar on *Orbit methods and automorphic forms* (based on [the paper](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/acta-mathematica/volume-226/issue-1/The-orbit-method-and-analysis-of-automorphic-forms/10.4310/ACTA.2021.v226.n1.a1.pdf) by Nelson and Venkatesh) with [Zhongkai Tao](https://math.berkeley.edu/~ztao/) and [CJ Dowd](https://math.berkeley.edu/~cjdowd/).
