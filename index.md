*I am on the academic job market in the Fall of 2025.*

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at UC Berkeley, advised by [Sug Woo Shin](https://math.berkeley.edu/~swshin/).
My research interests lie in computational number theory and, more broadly, in computer-assisted mathematics. This includes areas such as optimization problems (e.g., various linear programming problems involving automorphic forms), formalization, and the application of machine learning to pure mathematics.
I was one of the contributors for the [FrontierMath Tier4 benchmark](https://epoch.ai/frontiermath/tier-4).
I am also interested in automorphic forms and representations, particularly in the context of the (relative) Langlands program and Ichino-Ikeda type conjectures.

Previously, I completed a masterâ€™s program at POSTECH, where I was advised by [YoungJu Choie](https://yjchoie.postech.ac.kr/).
