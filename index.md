I'm 3rd year graduate student in Mathematics at UC Berkeley. My advisor is [Sug Woo Shin](https://math.berkeley.edu/~swshin/).
I'm interested in number theory, especially about automorphic forms and representations in context of relative Langlands program.
I'm also interested in computer-assisted mathematics, like optimization problems or formalization of mathematics.
During the master's program at POSTECH, I was supervised by [YoungJu Choie](https://yjchoie.postech.ac.kr/).
