The goal of this post is to explain **perverse sheaf** to someone who almost never learned it, from another beginner (ME!).
Note that I'm really not used to algebraic geometry, so I'll try to explain as easy as possible, ignoring many technical details (I think I cannot just ignore everything, since I also want to explain some of example calculations).
At least, I'd assume that you are familiar with basic graduate level algebraic geometry (as me... maybe), such as sheaves or schemes.

### Why it matters to me

The reason I'm learning these is to understand geometric Langlands more.

### Why it matters to you

There could be multiple reasons why it is good to know about perverse sheaves.
I think Mark Andrea de Cataldo and Luca Migliorini's AMS article "What is ... a Perverse Sheaf?" explains motivations very well.
