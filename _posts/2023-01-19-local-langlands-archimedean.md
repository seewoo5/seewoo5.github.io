In this post, we present the statement of Local Langlands Correspondence (LLC) over archimedean fields ($\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$) and sketch a proof.
The main reference is Knapp [ref], Borel [ref], and Jacquet [ref].


## Statement of Local Langlands Correspondence


Langlands correspondence relates *certain* representations of reductive groups and representations of *Galois groups*.
More precisely, for a given local field $F$ and a reductive group $G$ over $F$, *local* Langlands correspondence relates

$$
\text{admissible representations of }  G(F)
$$

and

$$
\text{admissible and continuous homomorphisms } \varphi: W_F \to {}^{L}G
$$

where $W_F$ is a Weil(-Deligne) group and ${}^{L}G$ is a Langlands dual group of $G$.
($W_F$ is not exactly the Galois group $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{F}/F)$, but an extension or a semi-direct product with some other group. We'll see the precise definition soon.)
We want the correspondences preserve some invariants such as $L$-functions.
