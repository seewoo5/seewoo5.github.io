Although I'm just a graduate student, I have years of experiences for teaching mathematics.
I tought my collegues and students in university (both when I was undergrad and grad), and also did some private tutorings.
From these experience, I have my own tips for teaching, which I'm going to describe here.

### What **ARE** you teaching?

This is the most basic but important question to answer when you're teaching some courses ~~(and I also found that some people don't know what they are teaching)~~.
For example, assume that you are teaching a calculus course for freshmen.
Obviously, you need to know about calculus (differentiations, integrals, etc) to *teach* them, otherwise you'll just say random words in your class and waste their time.
The ideal teacher should be able to answer *any* questions they ask (related to the topic), and even you don't know the answer, you should be able to answer it later.


### Not all calculus courses are the same

On ~~Twitter~~ X, I saw some controversy on changing the curriculum of calculus course.
In my opinion, the answer highly depends on the classes.
The calculus course for math majors and other majors would be different in the sense that their *goals* are different.
