In this post, we define general spin groups via Clifford algebra and give exceptional isomorphisms with other groups for low rank cases.
This post is based on the chapter 2 of M. Emory's "On the global Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for general spin groups", and T. Y. Lam's "Introduction to Quadratic Forms over Fields", but with a bit of more details.

## Clifford algebra and general spin groups

Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $\neq 2$ and $(V, q)$ be a quadratic space over $F$ of dimension $n$.
It means that $q: V \to F$ is a map such that $q(av) = a^2 q(v)$ for all $a \in F$ and $v \in V$, and $q(v + w) - q(v) - q(w)$ is a bilinear map.
We often associate a bilinear map $B = B_q: V \times V \to F$ as

$$
B(v, w) = \frac{1}{2} (q(v+w) - q(v) - q(w))
$$

which recovers $q$ by $q(v) = B(v, v)$.
We say that $v$ and $w$ are *orthogonal* if $B(v, w) = 0$.
Then we define a *Clifford algebra* $C(V)$ associated to the quadratic space $(V, q)$ as a universal unital associative algebra $C(V) = C(V, q)$ over $F$ with inclusion $i: V \to C(V)$ satisfying $i(v)^2 = q(v)\cdot 1$ for all $v \in V$.
It satisfies the following universal property: given any unital associative algebra $A$ over $F$ with a linear map $j: V \to A$ satisfying $j(v)^2 = q(v) \cdot 1_A$ for all $v \in V$, it factors through $i$.
Explicitly, it can be constructed as follows.
Let $T(V)$ be a tensor algebra associated to $V$, which is

$$
T(V) = F \oplus V \oplus V^{\otimes 2} \oplus V^{\otimes 3} \oplus \cdots.
$$

Let $I(V)$ be an ideal of $T(V)$ generated by the elements of the form

$$
v \otimes v - q(v)\cdot 1
$$

for $v \in V$. Then we can define $C(V)$ as $C(V):= T(V) / I(V)$, which satisfies the above universal property.
We also write $v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n = v_1 v_2 \cdots v_n$, and especially we have $v^2 = q(v)$.
One can easily check that $vw = -wv$ if $v$ and $w$ are orthogonal.
From this, we can construct a basis of $C(V)$ as follows: for an orthogonal basis $\\{v_1, \dots, v_n\\}$ of $V$, each element of $C(V)$ is a linear combination of elements of the form $v_{i_1}v_{i_2} \cdots v_{i_k}$ with $i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k$, so if we define

$$
C^k(V) = \left\{ \sum_i c_i v_{i_1} \cdots v_{i_k} : i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k\right\}
$$

then we have

$$
C(V) = C^0(V) \oplus C^1(V) \oplus \cdots \oplus C^k(V)
$$

and its dimension (as an $F$-vector space) becomes 

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n.
$$

From this viewpoint, $C(V)$ has a natural $\mathbb{Z} / 2$-grading (induced from that of $T(V)$) as

$$
\begin{align*}
    C^+(V) &= C^0(V) \oplus C^2(V) \oplus C^4(V) \oplus \cdots \\
    C^-(V) &= C^1(V) \oplus C^3(V) \oplus C^5(V) \oplus \cdots \\
\end{align*}
$$

which we call the *even* and *odd* Clifford algebra, with $\dim C^+(V) = \dim C^-(V) = 2^{n-1}$.
<!-- Note that, when $q = 0$ (i.e. $V$ is totally isotropic), then the Clifford algebra $C(V, 0)$ is isomorphic to the exterior algebra $\Lambda(V)$ of $V$. -->

From now, we will assume that $(V, q)$ is a *regular* quadratic space, i.e. the associated bilinear form $B_q: V \times V \to F$ is nondegenerate.
Now, we define the general spin group $\mathrm{GSpin}(V) = \mathrm{GSpin}(V, q)$ associated to $(V, q)$ as

$$
\mathrm{GSpin}(V, q):= \{ g\in C^+(V) : g^{-1} \text{ exists and } gVg^{-1} = V\}.
$$

One of the most important property of $\mathrm{GSpin}(V)$ is that it becomes a $\mathrm{GL}_1$-cover of the special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(V) = \mathrm{SO}(V, q)$.

<summary><i>Proof.</i></summary>

First, we need to defined the maps occur in the exact sequence. The first map $\iota: F^\times \to \mathrm{GSpin}(V)$ is given by the natural inclusion $F^\times \hookrightarrow F \hookrightarrow C^0(V) \hookrightarrow C^+(V)$, whose image is $C^0(V)^\times \simeq F^\times$ (and injective).
For the second map, we define $p: \mathrm{GSpin}(V) \to \mathrm{SO}(V)$ as

$$
p(g): v \mapsto gvg^{-1}.
$$

This is well-defined as a may $\mathrm{GSpin}(V) \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ by definition of $\mathrm{GSpin}(V)$ (we have $p(g)^{-1} = p(g^{-1})$), and it also preserves the quadratic form since

$$
q(gvg^{-1}) = (gvg^{-1})^{2} = gv^{2}g^{-1} = q(v) \cdot gg^{-1} = q(v).
$$

Also, it has determinant 1 since it is a conjugate of the identity map $v \mapsto v$.
Hence its image is in $\mathrm{SO}(V)$.
To prove surjectivity of $p$, we use the following theorem:

<blockquote>
<i>Theorem (Cartan-Dieudonn√©)</i> Let $(V, q)$ be a regular quadratic space of dimension $n$. Then every $\sigma \in \mathrm{O}(V, q)$ is a product of at most $n$ reflections. In other words, there exists anistropic vectors $w_1, \dots, w_r \in V$ with $r \leq n$ such that $\sigma = \tau_{w_1} \cdots \tau_{w_r}$, where

$$
\tau_w(v):= v - \frac{2B_q(v, w)}{q(w)}y.
$$
</blockquote>

Proof of the theorem can be found in [Lam, page 20].
Now, if $\sigma = \tau_{w_1} \cdots \tau_{w_r} \in \mathrm{SO}(V)$, then $\det(\sigma) = 1 = \det(\tau_{w_1}) \cdots \det(\tau_{w_r}) = (-1)^r$ and $r$ should be even.
So it is enough to show that every product of two reflections, $\tau_{w} \tau_{w'}$, is in the image of $p$.
In fact, a direct computation gives that in $C(V)$, we have

$$
\tau_y(x) = x - \frac{2B_q(x, y)}{q(y)} y = x - \frac{(xy + yx)}{q(y)} y = -yxy^{-1}
$$

hence 

$$
\tau_y(\tau_{y'}(x)) = -y(-y'xy'^{-1})y^{-1} = (yy')x(yy')^{-1}
$$

and $\tau_y \tau_y' = p(yy')$.

Obviously, we have $\mathrm{img}(\iota) \subset \ker(p)$ since $\mathrm{img}(\iota)$ lies in the center of $\mathrm{GSpin}(V)$.
For the reverse inclusion, it is equivalent to $Z(C(V)) = C^0(V) \simeq F$, which is true because Clifford algebras are central simple.

Note that the connected component of the center $Z^\circ$ of $\mathrm{GSpin}(V)$ is isomorphic to $F^\times$ for all $n \neq 2$.


There is a natural involution on the Clifford algebra, given by

$$
(v_1 v_2 \cdots v_k)^* := v_k v_{k-1} \cdots v_1
$$

where each $v_i$ is in $V$.
This gives a map

$$
N: C(V) \to C(V), \quad N(x) = xx^*
$$

for $x \in C(V)$, which we call *spinor norm*.
From anti-commutativity of orthogonal elements in $C(V)$, it follows that $C^+(V)$ is closed under the involution.
In fact, we have the following.

> **Proposition.** For $g \in \mathrm{GSpin}(V)$, $g^* \in \mathrm{GSpin}(V)$ and $N(g) \in C^0(V)^\times = F^\times$.

<summary><i>Proof [Scharlau, Lemma 3.2, page 335].</i></summary>

Let $g \in \mathrm{GSpin}(V)$.
By definition, we have $gV = Vg$, and taking involution on the both sides gives $g^* V = V g^*$, so $g^* \in \mathrm{GSpin}(V)$.
To show $gg^* \in C^0(V)^\times$, it is enough to show that $p(gg^*) = 1$ (where $p: \mathrm{GSpin}(V) \to \mathrm{SO}(V)$ is defined above).
Since $v^* = v$ for all $v \in V$, we have

$$
g^* v (g^{*})^{-1} = (g^* v (g^{-1})^{*})^* = g^{-1} v^* g = g^{-1} v g
$$

so

$$
gg^* v (gg^*)^{-1} = g(g^* v (g^*)^{-1})g^{-1} = g(g^{-1}vg)g^{-1} =v
$$

for all $v \in V$. Hence $p(gg^*) = p(N(g)) = 1$ and $N(g) \in F^\times$.

Note that Scharlau worked with slightly larger group called *Clifford group*.
