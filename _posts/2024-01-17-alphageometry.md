There are recent initiatives including [IMO Grand Challenge](https://imo-grand-challenge.github.io/) and [AIMO](https://aimoprize.com/) that seek for AI solving international mathematical olympiad problems and win a gold medal.
Although there are a lot of progress in theorem proving with AI, it can only solve some basic K12 or undergraduate calculus problem, and not good enough to solve olympiad-level problems or research-level problems.
It can *help* mathematical research by providing new insights based on the existing data, but for now AI can't prove any useful theorems itself.
