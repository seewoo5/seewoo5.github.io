In 2017, Deepmind released (preprint of) AlphaZero [1], which is an upgraded version of AlphaGo Zero (which is an AI playes Go) and can play Go, Chess, and Shogi.
Two years later, they released MuZero [2], which is a more generalized version of AlphaZero and can play both Atari and board games without knowledge of the rules or
representations of the game.

[^1]: I mean, it *was*. For now, there are some better players like AlphaGo-Zero and MuZero.
