I found that I still don't fully understand what Satake isomorphism(s) is (are), so I'll try to record the different versions of Satake isomorphisms in literatures and describe how these are related.
Main references are Gross's famous article on Satake isomorphism, Getz and Hahn's GTM book on automorphic representations (Chapter 7), and some other papers.

### Setup

Let $F$ be a nonarchimedean local field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}$, uniformizer $\varpi$, and the residue field $k = \mathcal{O} / \varpi$ with cardinality $q$.
Let $G$ be a reductive group over $F$.
Fix the "pinning" $T \subset B \subset G$, where $T$ (resp. $B$) is a maximal torus (Borel subgroup) of $G$.
Weil group of $T$ is defined as $W = N_G(T) / T$ (here $N_G(T)$ is the normalizer of $T$ in $G$).
As usual, denote the group of characters and cocharacters of $T$ as

$$
\begin{align*}
X^\bullet(T) &= \mathrm{Hom}(T, \mathbb{G}_{m}) \\
X_\bullet(T) &= \mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{G}_{m}, T)
\end{align*}
$$

which are free abelian groups of rank $l = \mathrm{rank}(T)$, and we have a canonical pairing via composition, valued in $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{G}\_{m}, \mathbb{G}\_{m}) = \mathbb{Z}$.

<!-- The main goal of Satake isomorphism is to understand *unramified* representations of $G(F)$. -->



### Following Gross "On the Satake isomorphism"

Gross's article can be found [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/CEAB94DAAF2C92E62B8E12D347BDA076).

### Following Getz-Hahn
