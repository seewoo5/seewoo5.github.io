## Learning seminar on Bruhat-Tits buildings

<p align="center">
<img src="/seminar/2025spring-bruhat-tits/BT-SL2Q2.png">
</p>

> The main goal of the seminar is twofold: (i) understand the Bruhat-Tits buildings attached to reductive groups, and (ii) study various applications of buildings. For example, we may talk about Moy-Prasad filtration and Yu's construction of supercuspidal representations, for representation theoriest. But there are a lot of other applications of buildings including (explicit) Local Langlands correspondence, $p$-adic geometry, topology, etc. Feel free to talk about whatever you are interested in, that is related to Bruhat-Tits buildings.


When: **Friday 5:00 pm - 6:00 pm + $\alpha$** (with Berkeley time)

Where: ~~Evans 748~~ **Evans 740** (updated!)

### ~~Topics to be covered (i.e. another vague schedule)~~ Further topics you may interested in

As we understand now (in theory) what are the buildings, we may study more applications of the theory of buildings or related topics.
Here are the possible topics that I can think of; please(!) let me know if you want to give a talk on any of these, or have any other topics in your mind.

- Moy-Prasad filtration

    - [Rabinoff's thesis](https://services.math.duke.edu/~jdr/papers/building.pdf) Chapter 5, or [Fintzen's note](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/fintzen/Fintzen_CDM.pdf)
    - Maybe [categorical Moy-Prasad](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12917) (Yang's thesis)?

- Yu's construction of supercuspidal representations

    - [Fintzen's note](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/fintzen/Fintzen_CDM.pdf). There were some historical *corrections* by [Fintzen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09819) and [Fintzen-Kaletha-Spice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09120).

- $p$-adic geometry, Berkovich spaces and compactifications of them

    - [Remy-Thuillier-Werner](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1362), use $p$-adic geometry to compactify buildings.

- Mostow strong rigidity theorem

    - [Lizhen Ji's note](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~lji/building-curve-complex-handbook.pdf) Section 6.2. There are other topological applications in the note, too.

- Local Langlands correspondence

    - [Aubert](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06735) and [Aubert-Plymen](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X21001992). For example, how the depth in Moy-Prasad filtration behaves under the local Langlands correspondence?

- (co)volume formula of arithmetic groups

    - Originally by [Prasad](http://www.numdam.org/item/PMIHES_1989__69__91_0.pdf), also in Chapter 18 of Kaletha-Prasad

- Deligne-Lusztig theory

    - [Chan's note](https://swc-math.github.io/aws/2025/2025ChanNotes.pdf), including recent developments of "positive depth" cases

There are some dependencies among them (for example, Moy-Prasad should be mentioned ealier than Yu's construction).
